This repository is an introduction to my classmate, Isaac. Also a guided intro to using Github for CS161.

  Isaac and I are similar in a few different ways, such as our hobbies are mostly the same, being video games and various other creative pursuits that can change almost daily. The best thing in both our lives right now is going to school and learning new things, and we don't really watch movies which is a common thing that we haven't really done: *Both of us haven't seen most horror movies*
  
  Isaac's favorite pair of shoes is a pair of running shoes which were **"damn comfortable"**. His favorite food combo is pasta stroganoff and wine, red wine specifically. :wine_glass: :fork_and_knife: :spaghetti:
  
  One of Isaac's favorite bands he mentioned is Blue Oyster Cult, their Wikipedia page can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_%C3%96yster_Cult). Another band he likes is Kansas. An image of the band is right here: ![Kansas Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Kansas_band_members_2016.jpg)
